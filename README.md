# Dissertation

This project was my final year dissertation project, accompanied by a written thesis, which received a first-class mark, the amalgamation of files that you see are all of the routes that were taken to finally get to the finished project. 

The steps taken through the project were to firstly create a functioning Echo server and client, then the project commenced with building structure off of that attempting to utilize the functionality of the boost library. When the server was in a position where data transfer between the server and client was sufficient the game logic was then built and implemented.

The finished files reside withing the EchoClient and DissertationServer folders.

The project also has a couple of failed attempts at creating a GUI. I feel that this is important to show this as it was a key highlighted part of my dissertation in which I discussed the time limitations and payoff of creating a GUI as this project was meant to demonstrate the networking that could be done in C++, not the game design.
